Unsupervised learning 
-clustering learning  - kmeans
-associate  learning
-Natural language processing


No previous output/ no understanding


We look for patterns in the data


Y does not give any meaningful significant answer, 
Rather it gives a number.
After plotting the points we decide the categories based on clusters


You categorize any new point based on characteristics




KMEANS CLUSTERING:
K-number of clusters in the graph
Have to find the value of k such that points are divided into categories that properly define their characteristics


Find k value by plotting accuracy curve-
At point of inflection that value of k is used.
Elbow method


Accuracy is measured by forming clusters and the sum of the distance between a point and every other points must be minimum
A cluster selects a leader by calculating the centroid of its points


Minimize intra cluster distance
Maximize inter cluster distance
