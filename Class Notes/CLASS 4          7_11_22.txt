REGRESSION
Line of best fit
Correlation coefficient


Simple linear: y=mx+c
Multiple linear:  y= m1a+ m2b+m3c….
nC2


Spurious tuple
Comparisons between a and d, b and d, c and d,  a and b, a and c, b and c 
All correlation should be checked
Correlation between the x’s should be low and between x and y high


  

Pearson’s correlation coefficient




1. M is same always, n =1
2. M is same always but n>1
3. M changes, n=1




POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION
Linear regression is used here to keep x in its line of best fit
